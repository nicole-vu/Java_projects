Both worked on MyMaze.java
– Any assumptions
-The solveMaze() method does not give the fastest way that would be taken to the end of the maze. It may make "mistakes"
and take the wrong path sometimes, but it will always start at the starting point and end at the end point
-The maze will have at least one path, but the maze may have more than one path that could get to the end
(a long way/short way) depending on how the maze was randomly generated.
– Additional features that your project had (if applicable)
Created an isDead() method to be used inside the makeMaze() method to check if a cell is out of bounds or if it has been
visited
– Any known bugs or defects in the program
