Contributions of each partner:
	- Nicole: Circle.java, Triangle.java, Rectangle.java, README.txt
	- Gina: FractalDrawer.java, style

How to compile and run the program:
	- to compile: use command "javac FractalDrawer.java" in terminal/command prompt
	- to run: use command "java FractalDrawer" in terminal/command prompt
	- Input the shape you want to draw ("rectangle", "circle", or "triangle") (Uppercase letters are acceptable)

Assumptions:
